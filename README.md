# Maker-Faire-Orlando-iOS


iOS Application for the 2016 Maker Faire Orlando

Now updated for Xcode 8 and Swift 3

## Todo

[ ] Would be great if the event data pre-loaded before the view appeared

[ ] The maker list should include the exhibit picture in list and detail

[ ] The JSON (and pictures) really should be cached


## Copyright and license

The copyright status and license is a little unclear.

The images (icon, map, launch screen badge, etc.) are definitely using licensed trademarks from Maker Media.
