# Maker-Faire-Orlando-iOS

iOS Application for Maker Faire Orlando

## Todo

[x] Would be great if the event data pre-loaded before the view appeared

[x] The JSON (and pictures) really should be cached when retrieved

[x] Map should be cached

[x] Pull-to-refresh

[x] The maker list should either have thumbnail images in cells or be changed to a UICollectionView with images

[ ] The detail view layouts are a little rough and should collapse labels when they're empty

[ ] The detail view layouts should handle images better - either resize imageview to match or crop images

[x] Fix calling setNetworkActivityIndicator on background thread

[?] Event JSON 404s in simulator but not on actual device
