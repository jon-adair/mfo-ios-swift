# Maker-Faire-Orlando-iOS

iOS Application for Maker Faire Orlando attendees

## Todo for 2020

[ ] Event JSON processing should better handle date order

[ ] Event segmented control should get dates from events JSON

[ ] Async lazy-loading of maker images should cancel async task on cell reuse

[ ] Async lazy-loading of event images should cancel async task on cell reuse

[ ] JSON and image caching should use a more stock solution

[ ] A lot of general fragility in error handling and optional unwrapping

[ ] Poor handling if site is offline, DDOSed, or unreachable

[ ] Would be good to hit a backup site if primary is offline

[ ] Really should ship with an initial set of cached JSON and images

[ ] The detail view layouts are a little rough and should collapse labels when they're empty

[ ] The detail view layouts should handle images better - either resize imageview to match or crop images

[ ] Maker collection view cell sizes could be better on different size classes

[ ] Maker collection view cell text could look better

[ ] Red color is not consistent throughout app

[ ] Map updating and caching logic is really rough

[ ] Want a way to refresh map but pull-to-refresh in that scrollview is bad UX
